1. **Title** : **World Crop Challenge**<br>
   **Description**: To estimate the yield between the tester crops in the given dataset.<br>
     https://www.ideaconnection.com/syngenta-crop-challenge/ <br>
   **Goal**: Developing it for the farmers so that better crop yield with appropriate nutrients can be developed.<br>
   
     _Note: Waiting on permission to use data-set for College Project for this idea._ <br>
   
   **Tech Stack** : TBD
   
2. **Title** : **Improving public transport using dynamic routing based on crowd movement prediction.** <br>
   **Description** : Help predict the movement of large crowds to/from periodic and publicly accessible events/destinations and dynamically allot bus routes to service them. This would provide the much needed public transport facility and help make effective utilization of state's resources.<br><br>
                     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z1KLpf_7tU  - This video discusses the need for public transportation in the US and the way people are affected due to lack of it. We're just trying to find a way to utilize the existing public infrastructure and resources in an efficient way. <br>   
   **Goal** : Improving public transport and efficient utilization of resources.<br>
   **Tech Stack** : TBD
   
3. **Title** : **Mental health in Tech Industry**<br> . APPROVED (read below)
you should also provide actionable insights and prescriptive analytics for employers. This should also have a survey built in to continuously figure this out in a company and suggest remediation. 

   **Description** : This project aims to understand the mental health conditions in the flourishing tech industries. OSMI -Open Source Mental Illness has taken various surveys  which gives us huge data on the current perception of mental health from both employees and employers. The project aims to analyze the relationship between parameters which may be  responsible for influencing the condition of the affected person. We are aiming to explore  the following questions:
    <br>
    a) How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?<br>
    b) How is the tech industries  behavior towards the issue of  mental health and how they are dealing it?<br>
    c) What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?<br>
