1. **Title** : **World Crop Challenge**<br>
   **Description**: To estimate the yield between the tester crops in the given dataset.<br>
     https://www.ideaconnection.com/syngenta-crop-challenge/ <br>
   **Goal**: Developing it for the farmers so that better crop yield with appropriate nutrients can be developed.<br>
   
     _Note: Waiting on permission to use data-set for College Project for this idea._ <br>
   
   **Tech Stack** : TBD
   
2. **Title** : **Improving public transport using dynamic routing based on crowd movement prediction.** <br>
   **Description** : Help predict the movement of large crowds to/from periodic and publicly accessible events/destinations and dynamically allot bus routes to service them. This would provide the much needed public transport facility and help make effective utilization of state's resources.  
   **Goal** : Improving public transport and efficient utilization of resources.<br>
   **Tech Stack** : TBD
